**_Guillaume Blanchet_** 
is a quantitative ecologist working on theoretical ecological problems at McMaster University in Hamilton (Ontario, Canada). My main interest is to study the distribution of single (populations) and multiple (community) species distribution in space and through time. Currently, my research focus on developing statistical and mathematical tools that would lead to a better understanding of how species distribute and how they interact among each other and with the environment. Although many aspects of my research are theoretical, the quantitative development I make have application in various subfield of ecology such as landscape ecology, limnology and conservation biology.
